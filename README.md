<h3>Google search results page</h3>

[Live demo](https://okidokitokiloki.github.io/google-search-results/)

## General info
This is a clone of a Google SERP, specifically, "the odin project". 
	
## Technologies
This is an exercise proposed by The Odin Project as part of their "foundations" module.

Project is created with:
* HTML

## Final thoughts
Please note that as Google algorithms change, so too does the content in related searches, so the questions I have, may not match current results of the same page. 
Number of search results changes dynamically with a random number generator.
As of writing, no media queries have been implemented so view sparingly, but this "should" change soon, it's on the list.
