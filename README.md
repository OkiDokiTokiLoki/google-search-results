## Final thoughts
Please note that as Google algorithms change, so too does the content in related searches, so the questions I have, may not match current results of the same page. 
All the content was hard-coded, nothing procedurally generated (maybe in the future I might add some JS to display dynamic numbers for # of searches or something). 
As of writing, I have not yet implemented any media queries or general device responsiveness so view sparingly, but this "should" change soon, it's on the list.
